# 0x05. NodeJS Basics
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and it's event-driven and non-blocking, which makes it efficient and lightweight.
Express.js, on the other hand, is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of writing server code, as it provides a set of robust features for building single, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It's part of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack, a popular full-stack JavaScript framework.
