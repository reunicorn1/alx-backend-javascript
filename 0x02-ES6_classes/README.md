# 0x02. ES6 classes

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced a new syntax for creating classes in JavaScript. This new syntax is more concise and easier to work with, especially for developers coming from other object-oriented languages.
Here's a basic example of an ES6 class:

```
class MyClass {
    constructor() {
        // constructor body
    }

    myMethod() {
        // method body
    }
}
```

In this example, MyClass is the class name, constructor is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with the class, and myMethod is a method on the class.
You can create an instance of the class and call methods on it like this:

```
let myInstance = new MyClass();
myInstance.myMethod();
```

ES6 classes also support inheritance using the extends keyword. This allows you to create a new class that inherits properties and methods from another class.
