JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for enhancing web pages to provide for a more user-friendly experience. It allows for things like creating dynamic content, controlling multimedia, animating images, and pretty much anything else you can think of that a website would need to do.
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is a version of JavaScript that introduced several significant improvements and new features. These include let and const for variable declarations, arrow functions for a more concise function syntax, template literals for easier string concatenation, and promises for handling asynchronous operations, among others. It's important to note that not all browsers support all ES6 features, so developers often use tools like Babel to ensure their code is compatible with all browsers.
